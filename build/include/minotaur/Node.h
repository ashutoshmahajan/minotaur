    * A Node is a node in the search tree or the branch-and-bound tree.
    * Associated with a node is a parent node from which the node is derived by
    * adding branching constraints. Similarly a node may have one or more
    * children each obtained by adding some branching constraints.
    * Associated with each node is an array (or vector) of modifications that
    * were applied to the parent in order to get the node. For instance, a
    * modification could be change of one or more bounds on the variables.
  
    * At each node, one can find a solution that is feasible to the original
    * instance or show that the relaxation at the node is infeasible or obtain
    * some other information. One can, at each node, solve a relaxation,
    * tighten it, preprocess it, run heuristics. 
  
    * A node that has been evaluated and does not need any further processing
    * and does not need to be branched upon is called a pruned node. A node
    * that has not been processed yet is called an active node. A node that has
    * been processed (is ready for branching or has been pruned) is called a 
    * fathomed node. A node whose all successors have been fathomed or deleted
    * can be deleted. Since we store at each node, the modification that
    * generated it from its parent, we can not delete nodes that have active
    * successors.
  
    * A Child of the current node can be obtained by applying a branch to the 
    * node. All immediate child nodes are saved in a vector.
